To fully understand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not normally participate in business transactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Rama\u1e0d\u00e2n is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or \u1e25ad\u00eeth) from the Prophet (\ufdfa). An authentic \u1e25ad\u00eeth\u00a0is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see\u00a024:6-10). In some cases, only women\u2019s testimony is accepted while men\u2019s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman\u2019s pregnancy or virginity.",

Based on 4:48, the only unforgivable sin in Islam is if someone dies while disbelieving in Allah or associating others with Him in worship. In an authentic narration collected by At-Tirmi\u2c6ci, the Prophet (\ufdfa) reports that Almighty Allah says, \"O children of Adam! As long as you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what you have done, and I will not mind. O \u00a0children of Adam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would \u02f9still\u02fa forgive you. O \u00a0children of Adam! If you were to come to Me with sins filling the whole world and then you came to Me without associating other gods with Me, I would certainly match your sins with forgiveness.\"",
  "77292": "This refers to the place where the judgment will be held. The Prophet (\ufdfa) is reported in a \u1e25ad\u00eeth\u00a0collected by A\u1e6d-\u1e6cabar\u00e2ni to have said, \u201cThe Judgment will be passed on an earth where neither blood has been shed nor any sin committed.\u201d",
  "77293": "This is emphasized in 21:105. The meaning is that Allah will award Paradise to the believers to be its residents forever. Some commentators say that the word \u201cinherit\u201d is used because of the understanding that when Allah created Paradise and Hell, He made places for all of humanity in both. Those who will go to Paradise will inherit the spots of the disbelievers who chose misguidance (which leads to Hell), and those who will go to Hell will inherit the spots of those who chose guidance (which leads to Paradise).",
  "77294": "The believers will praise Him for His grace, and the disbelievers will praise Him for His justice.",
  "76536": "i.e., Adam and Eve.",
  "76537": "The Quran is the only scripture that says marry only one. Unlike any previous faith, Islam puts a limit on the number of wives a man can have. Under certain circumstances, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives as long as he is able to provide for them and maintain justice among them\u2014otherwise it is unlawful. With the exception of Jesus Christ and John the Baptist (neither of whom were married), almost all religious figures in the Bible had more than one wife. According to the Bible, Solomon (\ufdfa) had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3) and his father, David (\ufdfa), had many wives and concubines (2 Samuel 5:13).",
  "76538": "A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war\u2014a common ancient practice in many parts of the world. Islam opened the door for ending slavery by making it an act of charity to free slaves. Many sins (such as breaking one\u2019s oath, unintentional killing, and intercourse with one\u2019s wife during the day of fasting in Rama\u1e0d\u00e2n) can be atoned by freeing a slave. According to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam also improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a mother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free, and their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master. With regards to slaves, Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa) says, \u201cFeed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not overwhelm them with work unless you assist them.\u201d He (\ufdfa) also says, \u201cWhoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his slave will be injured.\u201d In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries\u2014including the Muslim world.",

  "76540": "According to Islamic law of inheritance, a female\u2014whether she is a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, etc.\u2014gets one of three shares, depending on her closeness to the deceased:Less than a male\u2019s share. If she is a daughter, she will get half of the share of her brother, since he\u2014unlike his sister\u2014has to provide for the family and pay a dowry at the time of his marriage. More than a male\u2019s share. For example, if a man leaves $24 000 and six sons, two brothers, a wife, and a mother. The wife will get one-eighth ($3000), the mother one-sixth ($4000), each of the sons will receive about $2 833 and the two brothers will not get anything. An equal share. This is in the case of siblings from the mother\u2019s side (mentioned in verse 12 of this s\u00fbrah).",

The verse was revealed to the Prophet (\ufdfa) inside the Ka\u2019bah with the order to give the key back to its rightful owner.

It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat, the long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although the Prophet (\ufdfa) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for battle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses.
