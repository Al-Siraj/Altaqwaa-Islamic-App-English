  "76537": "The Quran is the only scripture that says marry only one. Unlike any previous faith, Islam puts a limit on the number of wives a man can have. Under certain circumstances, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives as long as he is able to provide for them and maintain justice among them\u2014otherwise it is unlawful. With the exception of Jesus Christ and John the Baptist (neither of whom were married), almost all religious figures in the Bible had more than one wife. According to the Bible, Solomon (\ufdfa) had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3) and his father, David (\ufdfa), had many wives and concubines (2 Samuel 5:13).",
  "76538": "A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war\u2014a common ancient practice in many parts of the world. Islam opened the door for ending slavery by making it an act of charity to free slaves. Many sins (such as breaking one\u2019s oath, unintentional killing, and intercourse with one\u2019s wife during the day of fasting in Rama\u1e0d\u00e2n) can be atoned by freeing a slave. According to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam also improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a mother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free, and their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master. With regards to slaves, Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa) says, \u201cFeed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not overwhelm them with work unless you assist them.\u201d He (\ufdfa) also says, \u201cWhoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his slave will be injured.\u201d In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries\u2014including the Muslim world.",
  "76539": "For example, in the case of orphaned children whose grandfather then dies, leaving behind other children, some scholars rule that an obligatory bequest should be made to them despite not having a share in inheritance.",
  "76540": "According to Islamic law of inheritance, a female\u2014whether she is a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, etc.\u2014gets one of three shares, depending on her closeness to the deceased:Less than a male\u2019s share. If she is a daughter, she will get half of the share of her brother, since he\u2014unlike his sister\u2014has to provide for the family and pay a dowry at the time of his marriage. More than a male\u2019s share. For example, if a man leaves $24 000 and six sons, two brothers, a wife, and a mother. The wife will get one-eighth ($3000), the mother one-sixth ($4000), each of the sons will receive about $2 833 and the two brothers will not get anything. An equal share. This is in the case of siblings from the mother\u2019s side (mentioned in verse 12 of this s\u00fbrah).",
  "76541": "\"Offspring\u201d here means any number of children\u2014male or female.",
  "76542": "And the father will take the rest of the estate.",
  "76543": "Although the existence of siblings reduces the mother\u2019s share from one-third to one-sixth, siblings themselves do not receive a share of inheritance and the rest of the estate goes to the father.",
  "76544": "Debts as well as any other financial obligations (such as funeral expenses, unfulfilled vows, or unpaid dowry) have to be repaid before the fulfilment of bequests, then the estate can be distributed among the heirs. A person can bequest up to one-third of their estate for charities as well as individuals who are not entitled to a share in inheritance.",
  "76545": "You do not know who will benefit you by looking after you during your life or doing good deeds on your behalf after your death.",
  "76546": "If there are two or more brothers and sisters from the mother\u2019s side, they share one-third equally\u2014the female will receive the same share of the male.",
  "76547": "Harming the heirs includes giving away more than one-third of the estate as a bequest.",
  "76548": "A person\u2019s repentance will be accepted as long as they repent any time before their death. But one should not procrastinate because they do not know when they will die.",
  "76549": "For example, a man would prevent a female relative (such as his sister or mother) from getting married so he can secure her estate for himself.",

  "76552": "A man was not allowed to have a relationship with a bondwoman who he had taken captive in war unless he made sure she was not pregnant. This was verified by her having at least one monthly cycle. See footnote for 4:3.",

  "76557": "This pledge was a common practice before Islam between friends and allies\u2014taking oaths to inherit each other. This practice came to an end with the revelation of verse 8:75 of the Quran. Although friends and allies do not have a share in inheritance anymore, they still can get some of the estate through bequest.",
  "76558": "i.e., their husbands\u2019 honour and wealth.",
  "76559": "Disciplining one\u2019s wife gently is the final resort. The earliest commentators understood that this was to be light enough not to leave a mark, should be done with nothing bigger than a tooth stick, and should not be on the face. Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa) said to his companions \u201cDo not beat the female servants of Allah.\u201d He said that honourable husbands do not beat their wives, and he himself never hit a woman or a servant. If a woman feels her husband is ill-behaved, then she can get help from her guardian or seek divorce.",

  "76561": "Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa) asked one of his companions, \u2019Abdullah ibn Mas\u2019\u00fbd, to recite some verses of the Quran for him because he loved to hear it from someone other than himself. \u2019Abdullah recited from the beginning of this s\u00fbrah\u00a0until he reached verse\u00a042. When he was told he may stop, \u2019Abdullah said he looked at the face of Prophet (\ufdfa) and saw tears rolling down his cheeks.",

  "76569": "See\u00a0footnote for 2:25.",
  "76570": "This verse was revealed right after Mecca had peacefully surrendered to the Muslims. \u2019Ali ibn Abi \u1e6c\u00e2lib, the Prophet\u2019s cousin and son-in-law, took the Ka\u2019bah\u2019s key by force from Othm\u00e2n ibn \u1e6cal\u1e25a, the non-Muslim keeper of the Ka\u2019bah. The verse was revealed to the Prophet (\ufdfa) inside the Ka\u2019bah with the order to give the key back to its rightful owner. He (\ufdfa) ordered Ali to return the key to the keeper immediately along with an apology. Othm\u00e2n was also promised that his family would keep the key forever. The keeper was so touched by the Quranic sense of justice that he decided to accept Islam.",
  "76571": "i.e., obeying Allah and His Messenger.",
  "76572": "Both good and evil are destined by Allah. The good comes as Allah\u2019s reward for good deeds, whereas the bad comes as Allah\u2019s punishment for evil deeds. In some cases, bad things happen to good people to test their faith, or as an atonement for their sins, or as part of a process of replacing something with what is better (e.g., a job or a spouse).",
  "76573": "i.e., when they get the news of victory or a threat.",
  "76574": "The verse discusses a group of people who nominally became Muslims and secretly supported the enemies of Muslims. For those hypocrites to prove their loyalty, they were commanded to emigrate and join the ranks of the believers, or they would be considered enemies.",

  "76577": "This includes women, the elderly, the sick, etc.",
  "76578": "This verse refers to some of those who had accepted Islam secretly in Mecca but refused to emigrate to Medina along with the rest of the believers.

The verse also applies to any Muslim who accepts abuse and refuses to move to another place where they can live with dignity and practice their faith freely.",
  "76579": "Generally, it is permissible for Muslims who are travelling a distance of 85 km or more to shorten their prayers. A four-unit prayer is reduced to two.",

  "76599": "This verse is placed at the end of the s\u00fbrah\u00a0and not with similar verses at the beginning to connect the end of this s\u00fbrah\u00a0with the next one or, according to Al-Fakhr Ar-R\u00e2zi, either to tie the end of the s\u00fbrah\u00a0with its beginning for emphasis, as found in 20:2 and 124 as well as 23:1 and 117, or to emphasize Allah\u2019s knowledge, just like the first verse emphasizes His power."
