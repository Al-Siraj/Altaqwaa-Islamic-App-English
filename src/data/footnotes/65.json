  "77520": "Meaning, when a husband intends to divorce his wife\u2014after the consummation of marriage\u2014he should divorce her outside her monthly cycle, provided that he has not touched her after her period. This makes it easy for the wife to observe her \u2019iddah\u00a0(waiting period for around three months, see\u00a065:4). Otherwise, things will be complicated for her. For example, if divorce happens after sexual intercourse, she might get pregnant, which delays the end of \u2019iddah\u00a0until the end of her pregnancy. If divorce happens during a monthly cycle, scholars are in disagreement as to whether the divorce counts or not. If it does not, she has to wait until her menstruation is over to see if her husband still wants to divorce her.",
  "77521": "Perhaps the husband who has divorced his wife may change his mind and restore the marriage before the end of her waiting period (after the first or second count of revocable divorce).",
  "77522": "A husband may separate from his wife after each of the first two counts of divorce or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he chooses to stay with her after the first two counts of divorce then divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period. The wife will have to marry and divorce another man before she can be remarried to her ex-husband (see\u00a02:230). However, a woman marrying someone with the intention of getting divorced, in order to return to her first husband, is forbidden.",
  "77523": "This applies to pregnant women who are divorced or widowed.",
  "77524": "After the divorce is finalized.",
  "77525": "This is one of the names of the Quran."
