  "77498": "A companion named Khawlah bint Tha\u2019labah had a disagreement with her husband, Aws ibn A\u1e63-\u1e62\u00e2mit, who then told her that she was as unlawful for him as the \u1e93ahr (back) of his mother. This statement had been considered to be a form of divorce (known as \u1e93ih\u00e2r) in Arabia. Khawlah came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) to ask for his opinion. He (\ufdfa) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard, and that, based on tradition, she was divorced. She argued that she and her husband had children together who would suffer if their parents were separated. Then she started to plead to Allah as the Prophet (\ufdfa) repeated the same answer. Eventually, this Medinian s\u00fbrah\u00a0was revealed in response to her pleas, thereby abolishing this ancient practice.",
