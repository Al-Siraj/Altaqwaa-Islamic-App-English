  "77626": "The Prophet\u2019s name is always mentioned in the call to prayer, along with Allah\u2019s Name. Close to the end of each of the five daily prayers, worshippers invoke Allah\u2019s blessings upon the Prophet (\ufdfa) and his family. When someone reverts to Islam, they testify that Allah is their Lord and Mu\u1e25ammad is His Messenger. Muslims, even those who are not practicing, love the Prophet (\ufdfa) and many name their children after him.",
  "77627": "If a definite noun is repeated in Arabic, it means that we are referring to the same thing. For example, \u201cI met the man and I gave the man some money.\u201d But if an indefinite noun is repeated, it means we are referring to two different things. For example, \u201cI met a man and I gave a man some money.\u201d With this in mind, we realize that 94:5-6 refers to one hardship (a definite noun) and two different eases (an indefinite noun). Hence, the Arabic saying: \u201cTwo eases cannot be overcome by one hardship.\u201d"
