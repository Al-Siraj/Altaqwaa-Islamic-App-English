The Prophet (\ufdfa) frowned and turned all his attention to the man he was already talking to. This Meccan s\u00fbrah\u00a0was later revealed, telling the Prophet (\ufdfa) that he should have tended to the faithful man who was eager to learn. After this s\u00fbrah\u00a0was revealed, the Prophet (\ufdfa) would honour \u2019Abdull\u00e2h, calling him \u2018the man for whom my Lord rebuked me.\u2019 He (\ufdfa) even appointed him several times as his deputy over Medina.",
