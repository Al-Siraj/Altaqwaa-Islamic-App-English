  "76600": "To make a decision in pre-Islamic Arabia, a person would draw one of three straws: one saying \u201cDo it,\u201d the other \u201cDo not do it,\u201d and the third was left blank, whereas in Islam there is a special prayer (called istikh\u00e2rah) for guidance when making a decision.",
  "76601": "\u201cThe food of the People of the Book\u201d here means the meat of the animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians.",
  "76602": "For example, following sexual intercourse or a wet dream.",
  "76603": "This ruling is called tayammum\u00a0or \u2018dry ablution.\u2019 See\u00a0footnote for 4:43.",

  "76605": "i.e., the miracles of splitting the sea, water coming out of the rock, manna and quails, and clouds shading them.",
  "76606": "In Islam, regret for doing something wrong is essential for repentance. But in the case of Cain, his regret was not for killing his brother, but for failing to bury his corpse to hide the evidence of his crime. Therefore, his regret was not intended as a step towards repentance.",
  "76607": "Although this is addressed to the Children of Israel, it is applicable to everyone at all times.",
  "76608": "This ruling (called \u1e25ir\u00e2bah) applies to crimes committed by armed individuals or groups against civilians\u2014Muslim or non-Muslim. Different punishments apply depending on the severity of the crime:In the case of murder or rape, offenders are to be executed.In the case of armed robbery, offenders\u2019 right hands and left feet are to be cut off.In the case of terrorizing innocent people, offenders are to be jailed in exile.Penalties for lesser offences are left for the judge to decide.",
  "76609": "In Islam, strict conditions must be met for punishments to be carried out. For example, for someone to be punished for theft, the thief must be a sane adult who knows that theft is forbidden, the crime has to be proven either by confession or the testimony of two reliable eyewitnesses, the stolen item has to be of value and taken secretly from a safe place, and the owner has to claim it. Otherwise, the punishment is not applied. Islamic punishments apply neither in non-Muslim countries nor in Muslim countries where Shar\u00ee\u2019ah\u00a0is not fully applied. Moreover, the punishment is only applicable in a society where the needs of the poor are adequately met (i.e., they receive alms-tax, charity, or welfare) and where theft is more out of desire than necessity. It is worth mentioning that \u2019Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e2b, Islam\u2019s 2nd\u00a0Caliph, suspended this punishment for one year due to widespread famine.",

The verse forbids Muslims from allying with the Jews and Christians (or anyone else) conspiring to persecute Muslims. On the other hand, as long as non-Muslims are not at war with Muslims or persecuting them, the Quran (60:8) commands Muslims to be kind and gracious to them.",
