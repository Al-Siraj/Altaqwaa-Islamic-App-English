  "77371": "This Medinian s\u00fbrah takes its name from the clear triumph (i.e., Treaty of \u1e24udaibiyah) in verse 1. The Prophet (\ufdfa) and 1400 of his companions travelled to Mecca to perform the minor pilgrimage (\u2019umrah) in 6 A.H./628 C.E. He (\ufdfa) sent \u2019Uthm\u00e2n ibn \u2019Aff\u00e2n to let the Meccans know that the Muslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the Meccans delayed \u2019Uthm\u00e2n, the Prophet (\ufdfa) thought they might have killed his envoy. So he (\ufdfa) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance to him under a tree at \u1e24udaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after, \u2019Uthm\u00e2n returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims and Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return to Medina and come back next year for \u2019umrah. The Treaty of \u1e24udaibiyah is described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily diffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave the Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their faith. Thousands from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce.",
