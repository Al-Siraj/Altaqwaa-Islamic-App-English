  "76701": "This s\u00fbrah, which is perceived as a continuation of the previous s\u00fbrah, begins by openly terminating the peace treaties constantly violated by the pagans. The believers are urged to march forth with the Prophet (\ufdfa) for the Battle of Tab\u00fbk in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. Hypocrites are exposed and their false excuses are refuted. Muslims are reminded of how Allah turned the believers\u2019 initial defeat into sweeping victory at the Battle of \u1e24unain and how Allah saved His Messenger (\ufdfa) from the pagans during his migration to Medina. Allah\u2019s acceptance of repentance is echoed throughout the s\u00fbrah, hence its title.",
  "76702": "This is the only s\u00fbrah\u00a0in the Quran that does not begin with: \u201cIn the Name of Allah\u2014the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.\u201d The reason is that this s\u00fbrah\u00a0is considered to be a continuation of the previous one, and that it begins with an open termination of treaties not fully respected by the polytheists. Since this constitutes a declaration of war, it would not be fitting to open with the mention of Allah\u2019s compassion and mercy.",

  "76706": "After the Muslims\u2019 victory in Mecca in 8 A.H/630 C.E., almost all Arab tribes pledged allegiance to the Prophet (\ufdfa) except some tribes such as Haw\u00e2zin and Thaq\u00eef. Both tribes decided to attack the Muslims, so the Prophet (\ufdfa) led an army of 12 000 soldiers to attack the two tribes. Since that was the largest Muslim army ever mobilized, some Muslims expressed their conviction that such an army could not be defeated. However, on the way to battle, the Muslim army was ambushed and most soldiers fled, except for the Prophet (\ufdfa) and a few loyalists. Eventually, the Muslims were re-organized and won a decisive battle.",

  "76712": "To fully understand this verse we need to bear in mind that Quranic verses are of two types. General verses talk about belief in Allah, good manners, and acts of worship. Specific verses, such\u00a0as this verse, were revealed in regards to particular situations. This s\u00fbrah\u00a0came at a time when the pagans of Arabia (and their allies) repeatedly violated treaties they had signed with the Prophet (\ufdfa). Muslims had to fight for the survival of their newly established state in Medina. So this verse discusses dealing with those who violated their agreements and attacked the Muslims. Offenders were fought, unless they stopped their aggression. If they chose not to accept Islam, they were obligated to pay Jizya-tax.",
  "76713": "Taxation systems have existed since ancient times. There are several references in the Old Testament (e.g., Ezra 4:20).

The jizyah\u00a0was an average of one dinar (4.25 g of gold) annually. Women, children, the elderly, the clergy, the poor, and those who were unable to work were exempt. Those who opted to join the army were also exempt. Poor \u2c6cimm\u00ees\u00a0were supported financially by the state. Muslim rulers refunded the jizyah\u00a0if they failed to protect their non-Muslim subjects.",

  "76718": "The fast pace of the spread of Islam in Arabia in the 7th\u00a0century was intimidating to the world\u2019s two superpowers of that time: the Romans and Persians. The Prophet (\ufdfa) received the news that a Roman army was being mobilized to launch an attack on the newly established Muslim state in Medina, so he announced that he was going to march to Tab\u00fbk, located over 700 miles to the north, to meet the Romans in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat, the long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although the Prophet (\ufdfa) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for battle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses. Eventually, the Roman forces were discouraged from fighting and fled to Damascus and other cities under Roman rule. Therefore, the Prophet (\ufdfa) returned to Medina with a feeling of triumph. With a new power now emerging in Arabia, many tribes started to switch their alliances from Caesar to the Prophet (\ufdfa).",

The new mosque, commonly referred to as Masjid A\u1e0d-\u1e0cir\u00e2r\u00a0(Mosque of Harm), was intended to attract other hypocrites and reduce the number of Muslims who prayed at Qub\u00e2'. The hypocrites who built the mosque also anticipated the arrival of Abu \u2019\u00c2mer with Roman forces to expel the Prophet (\ufdfa) and Muslims out of Medina. Upon a request from these hypocrites, the Prophet (\ufdfa) had planned to visit the new mosque once he returned from Tab\u00fbk, but verses 107-110 of this s\u00fbrah\u00a0were revealed, warning the Prophet (\ufdfa) against that mosque.
