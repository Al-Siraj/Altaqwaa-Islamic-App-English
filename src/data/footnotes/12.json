According to some Quran commentators, it was Joseph\u2019s brothers who sold him to the travellers after he was picked up from the well.

Hyksos rulers were called kings, not pharaohs. Joseph entered Egypt during the reign of the Hyksos, who used to appoint some foreigners to prominent positions in Egypt.
