  "76859": "Al-Isr\u00e2' refers to the Prophet\u2019s Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem about a year before his emigration (or Hijrah) from Mecca to Medina. This journey came as a comfort for the Prophet after several years of hardship and persecution, which included a 3-year siege by Meccan pagans, who drove the Muslims out of the city and forbade anyone from trading, marrying, or feeding them. This was followed by the \u201cYear of Sadness,\u201d which included the death of the Prophet\u2019s uncle Abu \u1e6c\u00e2lib, the major defender of Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa) despite his disbelief in his message, as well as the death of the Prophet\u2019s beloved wife Khad\u00eejah. The Prophet was carried overnight by a noble steed (called Bur\u00e2q) from Mecca to Jerusalem where he met some earlier prophets and led them in prayer. He was later carried to the heavens (this journey is called Al-Mi\u2019r\u00e2j, or the Ascension) where he received direct orders from Allah to observe five daily prayers. The Ascension is referred to in 53:13\u201318.",
